My personal site (that will likely never launch). The photo was licensed, but the content is ripped off agency sites for now.

## To Do
- Figure out what I want to put on it
- Finish the copy
- Finish the content
- Use CSS instead of backstretch.js
- Change the CSS to be mobile first
- Figure out what to do w/ the non retina images & sprites (SVG? Icon Font? Compass?)

## Dependencies
- Hammer App (http://hammerformac.com)
